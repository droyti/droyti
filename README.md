### Heyo!

My name's Violet. I love The Walking Dead, storytelling, and all types of video games!

I'm currently working on the [Telltale Script Editor](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/Telltale-Script-Editor), an effort by me and a few others to increase the accessibility of modding games built with the Telltale Tool.

### ðŸ‘‹ I'm always happy to collaborate!

Know something about the Telltale Tool? Have an idea for a mod? Want to talk about the intricaies of The Walking Dead? [Contact me](https://droyti.github.io)!
